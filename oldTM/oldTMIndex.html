		<h2>"Where is Tyler? Is he alright? How long is his moustache now?"</h2>
		<p>-<i>anyone with their priorities in order</i></p>
		<p>Well, this blog isn't working how I imagined. I've tried sitting down to write posts numerous times. Between fighting with my computer and/or the internet to get photos on the site, actually processing everything into words people will understand or want to read, and general fatigue, I just don't want to try and process all of this right now.
		<br>
		<br>
		As anyone reading this knows, I don't like social media. I <i>especially</i> don't like Facebook and Instagram. However, I find a balance in the things I do and do not like about social media in Twitter. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I created a Twitter account for my travels, <a href="https://twitter.com/travelmoustache"> @travelmoustache.</a> While I'm bummed I'm not able to keep up with the blogging, it's a huge weight off my back to not have to worry about it as much. I mean, I told <i>a lot</i> of people about this blog and didn't update it but once in almost two weeks. While I'm sure anyone that's bothered to check this doesn't care, it still feels like I made a promise to tons of people that I didn't keep.
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>"But Tyler"</i>, I hear you say. <i>"Don't worry about the blog, just have fun while you're away!".</i> Wow, thanks! My thoughts exactly!
		<br>
		<br>
		That being said, this is not the end of my blog. I still want to use my blog for longer posts. Twitter isn't the place for long write ups about the places I go. Twitter is the place for posting random photos every day, which is more of what I want to show people in the first place. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Anyway, I want to post this before I get distracted again (this is the third time I've sat down to write this!). It's our last day in Istanbul. After staying out far too late, I've woken with far too little sleep and want to pack as much into this day as I can. Thanks for reading, and make sure to check back every once in a while for updates!

		<h2>
			"Varna, Bulgaria? Where's that?"
		</h2>
		<p>
			-<i>literally everyone I told I was going to Varna</i>
		</p>		
		<p>
			Sunday, May 5th, 2019, 10:00AM 
			<br>
			Ok, so, no one I told about my trip knows where Varna is. That's a damn shame, because this place is very, very cool, but it checks out. A few locals we've spoken with say they don't get many Americans here. Some people couldn't tell where we are from by our accents. One woman kept asking if we were English (ha!). At a wine tasting Andrew and I failed to partake in, the woman who greeted us said they've never served Americans before. So, yes, that Americans do not know of Varna, Bulgaria definitely makes sense. 

		<br>
		<br>
			We've had a good, albeit slow, time since arriving two days ago. Our plane landed Friday at 7ish AM. We made our way into town by a bus that costs 1 Bulgarian lev ($1 = 1.75 lev; more on that later). The first day was pretty rough energy-wise. We couldn't check into our AirBNB until 1:30 PM but were allowed to drop our bags off early. We walked around Varna like sleepless zombies for a few hours, taking in the sights. Funny story: every restaurant we tried to go to for breakfast had wrong hours on Google Maps. Maps would state they opened at 9 or 10 AM, and there were people there working (opening duties like cleaning, setting tables), but they wouldn't serve food until 11AM. We could not find a single place that served food before 11AM. It's as if no one here eats out for breakfast. Very strange compared to the US when you think of all the 24 hour fast food places, or restaurants like First Watch that are specifically for breakfast. 
		<br>
		<br>
			We eventually found someplace we could sit and wait with coffee while they finished opening. I ordered ribs with potatoes, a double esspresso, and a liter of water. It costs something like 20 lev total, or around $11.50. It was delicious, and that it costs so little is dumbfounding. Everything here is that cheap, though. The most expensive meal either of us has had has been less than $15, drinks included. And, unlike Ecuador (sorry Ecuador), the food is cheap and <i>good</i>. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Here's a big ole list of stuff about Varna: 
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li>The people here are quiet and reserved. They scarcely make eye contact.</li>
				<li>There are very few beards here. I have yet to see one larger than mine, and no moustaches are grown long.</li>
				<li>The food is mostly delicious. The one Bulgarian dish I had was deer hind with potatoes and peppers (pictured below). That was scrump-didly-uptious.</li>
				<li>The city feels old, but with a few new coats of paint. Like, there is one Starbucks, and a lot of new clothing/sunglass/purse shops (high-end touristy type places), but they're concentrated in the downtown area. Otherwise, it's mostly nice restaurants, little grocery stores, book stores, and densely packed apartments.</li>
				<li>The Black Sea is blue. </li>
				<li>The Black Sea is cold (in early May). </li>
				<li>We went to the archeological museum and saw the oldest gold artifacts in the world. They sound more impressive than they look.</li>
				<li>The coffee has mostly been good. Some of it has tasted like instant coffee. They have instant coffee vending machines all throughout the city. </li>
				<li>Everyone smokes. They smoke in a lot of restaurants, too. </li>
				<li>You might think I mean some people smoke and some people do not smoke. That's probably more accurate, but it legitimately feels like <i>everyone</i> in Varna smokes.</li>
				<li>People speak a little English. We've met one bartender that's basically fluent.</li>
				<li>There are a lot of stray cats. Pretty much the opposite of the stray dogs in Ecuador.</li>
				<li>Most of the dogs we've seen have been chuahuas and pomeranians.</li>
				<li>There is one stray dog downtown that I thought must have been dead when I first saw him. Turns out he was just sleeping. We've passed him frequently and he's barely moved. If he moves, it's to be in the shade. 
				<li>The nights and mornings have been cold, around 50F. The days have been warm, 60-70F.</li>
				<li>We took a bus 20 minutes north to the Golden Sands area. This seems like it's where all the rich tourists stay. It was pretty dead while we were there. There was a small market selling things you'd usually see at a beach market: sandals, swimming wear, sunscreen. One notable exception was the trinket store that had an array of mugs with Putin on them and a couple stacks with Trump.</li>
				<li>Two men's restrooms I've visited have had pictures of women with very surprised looks on their faces in front of the urinal. One of these restrooms had the same thing in the women's stall, but it was a creepy cowboy-looking dude peering through wooden planks. </li>
				<li>The people here are beautiful. The men are tall and cut, the women are gorgeous and curvy. Seriously, the average person here is like a 9. Varna is just plain-ole full of beautiful folk.</li>
				<li>For a city full of smokers, it wasn't uncommon to see people working out all around (runners, people working out in parks).</li>
				<li>The crows (ravens?) here are black and grey, unlike North America's all-black crows.</li>
				<li>The music here is so, so good. Every cafe and restaurant is rocking some kind of chill modern jazz/house/trance tune, or straight up disco (less good, but enjoyable in the moment).</li>

			</ul>

		I'm currently in Madrid's Madrid-Barajas airport, waiting for our third of four flights to board. It's been an adventure so far. The flight from Atlanta to NYC's JFK airport had me surrounded by screaming and kicking children for two hours, while the flight from JFK to Madrid was delayed an hour and its gate changed repeatedly. When the third (and final) gate change was announced, the crowd let out a collective sigh and chuckle, everyone simultaneously acknowledging the ridiculousness of the situation. 
		<br>
		The flights have been cool otherwise. The headrest on the flight from Atlanta to JFK showed the plane's speed, altitude, and location. The flight to Madrid had this as well. This is new to me. Maybe it's standard? 
		<img src="images/virginiaMapView.jpg">

		The flight to Madrid was overnight. It was a nice chance to get some shut-eye. I was lucky enough to get a window seat on the left side of the plane and got some pretty cool photos coming into Madrid.

		Andrew. It was Andrew. Andrew called me a moustache with legs. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Also, I may not have mentioned, I'm traveling with my friend Andrew from Ohio through Rome. He's neat! We're in Sophia now. Customs took roughly 30 seconds. The agent asked me what I was doing in Bulgaria. I told him I was going to Varna. He acted kind of surprised (???) and let me go on my way. Just like Ecuador, no one checked my bag. Safety! 
		<br>
		<br>
		It's 3:30 in the AM here, May 3rd. I've been sleeping here and there since 7AM on May 1st. I think I've slept about 6 or 7 hours total, frequently interupted as it normally is on planes. We're planning on staying up through this evening. We can't check into our AirBNB until 2PM, so it's not like we have any place to sleep, and there is this awesome vacation/new place/travel energy/excitement that is going to be driving us when we land in Varna and spend some time someplace foreign that's not just another airport. 
		<br>
		<br>
		I'd like to update the CSS for this blog more later. For now, I dig the simplistic look. I shrank the width of everything so text is easier to read and photos aren't all over the place. I'll add a lot more photos next time. And more content. There just isn't a lot to update about when all you're doing is hanging around airports, ya dig? 
		<br>
		<br>
		Thanks for reading!
