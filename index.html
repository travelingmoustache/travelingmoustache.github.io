    This was hastily made while learning <a href="https://pages.github.com/">how to use Github Pages</a>, <a href="https://domains.google/#/">how to purchase domain names</a>, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-supported-custom-domains">what apex and subdomains are</a>, and how to <a href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4522141">configure your Google-purchased domain so it forwards to your Github pages URL</a>.
